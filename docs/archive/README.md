## Why Archived?

These documents were moved to archive because:

1. **Feature Discontinued**: The feature is no longer part of the application
2. **Superseded**: Better/newer documentation exists elsewhere
3. **Completed**: One-time implementation guides that are no longer relevant
4. **Historical**: Valuable for context but not needed for current development
